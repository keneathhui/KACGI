**Official Implementation for the Paper:**  
**KACGI: Addressing Scarcity, Heterogeneity, and Uncertainty in Tabular Data Imputation**

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To set up the environment, simply run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate KACGI
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can run the following basic command to perform data imputation on the Adult dataset using KACGI:
